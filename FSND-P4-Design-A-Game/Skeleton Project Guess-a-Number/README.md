##Game Description:
You are requested to guess 3digit number(all digit is different number from 0~9) within 10 tries.
Every time you guessed number, you will get feedback as below example.
number and digit matches --> "strike"
number exists in target --> "ball"

EX. Target = 234.
Guess 234 = 3-strike and 0-ball where player won.
Guess 235 = 2-strike and 0-ball where 2 and 3 matches with Target
Guess 243 = 1-strike and 2-ball where 2 matches with Target, 4 and 3 exists in Target
Guess 423 = 0-strike and 3-ball where 2, 3 and 4 exists in target but digit not matches
Guess 782 = 0-strike and 1 ball where 2 exists in target but digit not matches

Players are ranked based on win qty.

Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
